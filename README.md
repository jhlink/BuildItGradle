# Udacity Gradle Module

## Submission Notes

- To avoid publicly sharing the developer AdMobs API key, create in the project root directory a file called "ENV_KEYS" and provide a test API key in the following format. Note: No quotes necessary. :) 
ADMOB_KEY = [insert_key]
- The GCE_Test gradle task may be found in the Gradle tab and under the app project within the Verification group.
The task is called "setupGceAndTestAll".
